    "\n",
    "The simulation results can be summarized in four main illustrations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "First, Figure~\\ref{fig:N_effect} shows the effect of the number of blocks $N$ on the estimated bandwidth $\\hat h$ and on Mallows’ $C_p$. When $N$ is small, each block contains many observations, which produces stable polynomial fits but also biased curvature estimates, leading to bandwidths that are systematically too large. As $N$ increases, the blocks shrink and the quartic fits become unstable, causing large variability in both $\\hat\\theta_{22}$ and $\\hat h$. The $C_p$ criterion successfully identifies an intermediate value of $N$ that balances bias and variance, thereby providing a stable choice of bandwidth.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, Figure~\\ref{fig:size_n} illustrates the effect of the sample size $n$. As expected, the distribution of $\\hat h$ shifts towards smaller values as $n$ grows, consistent with the theoretical scaling law $h \\propto n^{-1/5}$. Moreover, the spread of the boxplots decreases with larger $n$, confirming that the plug-in estimator becomes more stable with more data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Third, Figures~\\ref{fig:beta_densities} and~\\ref{fig:beta_effect} investigate the role of the covariate distribution. Figure~\\ref{fig:beta_densities} shows the shapes of several Beta distributions used for the covariates. The Beta(0.5,0.5) distribution produces a U-shape, concentrating data near the boundaries and leaving the middle region sparse. Beta(2,2) yields a bell-shaped distribution with higher density in the center, while Beta(5,1) produces a strongly skewed distribution concentrated near zero. Figure~\\ref{fig:beta_effect} then shows how these different covariate distributions affect the bandwidth estimator. The results clearly demonstrate that homogeneous covariate distributions such as Beta(2,2) lead to more stable estimates of $\\hat h$. In contrast, unbalanced or U-shaped distributions increase the variability of $\\hat h$, since sparse regions make the estimation of second derivatives less reliable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, these figures confirm that (i) the block size $N$ must be chosen carefully, with Mallows’ $C_p$ providing a suitable selection rule, (ii) the sample size $n$ drives both the rate and stability of the estimator in agreement with asymptotic theory, and (iii) the shape of the covariate distribution strongly affects the variability of the plug-in estimator, with dense and balanced covariate distributions being most favorable.  \n",
